It helps users to search artwork based on their liking. The artists and customers have to be registered to make good use of the system. Artists can promote and sell their art work. They can also decide if they want to auction or sell their work for a fixed price. Information about the artistâ€Ÿs and their art works along with proper authentications are obtained. The website provides various categories of art styles and frame styles. The records are updated and modified frequently. This allows the users to view and buy latest collection. Information about donations and gifts made to the gallery are also stored. The system consists of information about exhibitions conducted like date, time, address etc. The customers can place order for the paintings. They can also participate in online auction by submitting their bid amounts. The highest bidder should remit the amount by online transaction. Once the payment for the auctioned or ordered art work is made, the art works are shipped to the customer. Shipping requires the contact details of the customers which is also stored in the system.
