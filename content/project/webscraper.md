The project is divided into two parts:

1. Data Retrieval
      Based on the html-standard provided at https://html.spec.whatwg.org/ the dynamic html pages consisting of Covid-19 and Vaccination data are parsed using Python script.The data that is retrieved is then Cleaned and processed to be saved in usable format .

2. Data Visualization
    The data that is retrieved is then visualized using R programming after analyzing various trends and variables over time and presented through charts and graphs.The visuals aim at providing visuals after filtering data based on the specifications provided  by the user. The filters can be that for a location , date or  tranding covid-19 areas or number of cases. 
    
    This project is still in process and Will be completed by December 2021.
