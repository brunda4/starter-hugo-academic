Biometric deals with Identification of individuals based on their biological or behavioral characteristics. Iris recognition system is regarded as the most reliable and accurate biometric identification system available. Traditional personal authentication methods have many instinctive defects. Biometrics is an effective technology to overcome these defects. Among the available biometric approaches, iris recognition is one of the most accurate techniques. In this project work, an approach for Iris recognition system has been proposed. Simple morphological operations and two dimensional median filtering techniques are used to detect the pupil. The noises such as eyelashes, reflections are removed through the linear thresholding. The 1D log Gabor wavelet transformation is applied for feature extraction from segmented iris image. The Humming Distance has been adopted as the metric of dissimilarity between input iris template and enrolled iris templates. From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed approach is more efficient compare to existing methods viz. Masekâ€™s method for the considered dataset. It is also observed that proposed approach takes reasonable amount of time to perform iris segmentation and recognition accuracy is also reasonable.
