  description: All of us have been part of numerous presentations and can many of them have had a clear impact on us while others have taken a while to make sense. This particular course describes data visualization and its presentation is an intersection between analysis and an art ; it indeed is!! The course helps emphasize the importance of presenting a visual well to make it impactful and understand all the efforts that goes behind it . We studied about different frameworks of data visualization, Design Principles, Possible graphs/charts and need for static or dynamic visuals one could use in different scenarios, the difference between correlation and causation ,Design Thinking, hands-on activities working with spreadsheets and Tableau, created dashboards, created and analyzed slide decks , worked on best practices required for effective presentation and how to prepare ourselves for QA's and handling objections, if any, at the end of our presentation.
