summary: Old SQL vs NoSQL vs NewSQL
abstract: "Relational Database has been the prime data management standard all around the world for several years. It has been the legacy vendor with mediocre performance in the new world. The need for faster, more scalable and flexible data management system raised in the recent years, that led to the development of NoSQL. However, NoSQL compromised on SQL and ACID to obtain Scalability. Hence a new Data Management System called NewSQL was brought into light which is ACID compliant, SQL based, Scalable, Distributed and highly available RDBMS system. They focus on making the Traditional SQL (RDBMS) perform better and scale better than NoSQL."
